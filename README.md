Geotagger
=========

About
-----

GeoTagger is a demonstrator application for the [Horizon][] infrastructure project utilising
the Android and Cloud based personal data stores.  It consists of two parts, the first is a
Google App Engine server that stores images and text with a geo-location.  The second is an
Android client that allows for geo-located images and text to be pushed to the server via
the personal data store, and for a user to explore the landscape to find geo-located objects
that other users have dropped.
